<h1>so im adding some things on to github and its cool </h1>
<p> once uppon a time all i did was play final fantasy 11 and it was cool, until final fantasy 14 came out and i have been in love ever since. did you know that the newest expansion called storm blood is coming out? it completely changes the flow of the game and battle interactions.</p>
<h3>Programming languages</h3>
<p>so in the future i would like to try and master web dev languages like angular, react, java, js, ruby, rubyrails etc. that help me persue that, however i would also like to learn mobile development such as swift and possibly any other language that helps me in system architecture.</p>
